I'm trying to make a game using Kotlin and LibGDX. 
I want to make the code really Functional. 

# Functional programming 
* Functional programming - Functions are worked as values. They can be storied in variables, passed as parameters, or returned from other functions.
* Immutability - Work with immutable objects, which guarantees that their state can't change after their creation.
* No side effects - Use pure functions that return the same results given the same inputs and don't modify the state of other objects or interact with the outside world.
